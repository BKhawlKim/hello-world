What's impossible?
Have asked yourself?
Do you know what is possible?
Then you have to start doing what us possible snd both impossible.
Then you will find your answer.
Try first, and continue to try.
It doesn't end just because you stop.
Everything keeps continuing without or without you so keep continuing.
That is me.
My name is Khawl Kim.
I wasn't born with coding 
I was not brought up with coding.
But I love ut, love to try it.
Knew nothing. Now still learning.
When will it stop? Never, maybe.
